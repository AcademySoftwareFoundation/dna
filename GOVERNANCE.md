# DNA Project Governance

DNA is a project of the Academy Software Foundation and relies on the ASWF governance policies, supported by the Linux Foundation. 

DNA aims to be governed in a transparent, accessible way for the benefit of the community. All participation in this project is open and not bound to corporate affiliation. Participants are bound to the project's [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

The project is structured around a Technical Steering Committee (TSC) which has the final authority on the decisions around the project. Reponsibilities of the TSC include but not limited to:

* Management of the project GitHub repository and associated logistics
* Technical oversight and decision making regarding DNA's implementation
* Managing communications and marketing regarding the project

The TSC will meet at a cadence deemed appropriate by the TSC committee. The TSC meeting agenda will be shared with all appointed roles and on the DNA slack channel at least 1 day before the TSC meeting.

See [ASWF TSC FAQ](https://tac.aswf.io/process/tsc_faq.html) for more details.

# Decision Making

DNA will operate primarily through consensus and discussion against agenda items raised by the TSC members in the TSC meetings, if concsensus is not easily achieved, decisions will go to a vote of at least 80% TSC members with a simple majority to decide the resolution.

* Submit your code as a PR with the appropriate DCO sign-off
* Have your submission approved by the committer(s) and merged into the codebase.

### When does a committer lose committer status

If a committer is no longer interested or cannot perform the committer duties listed above, they
should volunteer to be moved to emeritus status. In extreme cases this can also occur by a vote of
the committers per the voting process below.

# Release Process

Project releases will occur on a scheduled basis as agreed to by the committers.

# Conflict resolution and voting

In general, we prefer that technical issues and committer membership are amicably worked out
between the persons involved. If a dispute cannot be decided independently, the committers can be
called in to decide an issue. If the committers themselves cannot decide an issue, the issue will
be resolved by voting. The voting process is a simple majority in which each committer receives one vote.

# Communication

This project, just like all of open source, is a global community. In addition to the [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md), this project will:
* Keep all communication on open channels ( mailing list, forums, chat ).
* Be respectful of time and language differences between community members ( such as scheduling meetings, email/issue responsiveness, etc ).
* Ensure tools are able to be used by community members regardless of their region.

If you have concerns about communication challenges for this project, please contact the committers.

# Process for role transitions

If a person holding an appointed role - suitable notice must be given when stepping down and a replacement (if required) will be proposed for inclusion by vote during the next TSC meeting. If an appointed role has not been active and remains out of contact for a period deemed appropriate by the TSC members and - then that role will be put up for nomination by the commitee.
